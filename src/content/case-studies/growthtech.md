## The Challenge

GrowthTech, a leading FinTech company, was facing a crisis in their sales development function:

### Escalating Costs

- Only 15% of meetings converting to opportunities

### Scale Limitations

- Training bottlenecks
- Management overhead growing faster than output

"We were caught in a vicious cycle," explains Jennifer Walsh, CRO at GrowthTech. "The more we grew, the more complex and expensive our SDR operation became."
