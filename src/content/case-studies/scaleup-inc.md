## The Challenge

ScaleUp Inc., a fast-growing MarTech startup, faced the classic scaling challenge: how to rapidly expand their sales pipeline without breaking the bank. After closing their Series A, they had aggressive targets:

- 3x revenue growth in 12 months
- Expand into enterprise segment
- Maintain CAC payback under 12 months
- Build pipeline for Series B fundraising

With only 3 SDRs and limited budget for expansion, traditional scaling methods weren't viable.

## The Solution

ScaleUp Inc. deployed Harper AI as their "SDR force multiplier," implementing a comprehensive outbound strategy:

### Multi-Channel Orchestration
Harper AI coordinated outreach across multiple channels:
- Email sequences with dynamic personalization
- LinkedIn connection requests and messages
- Phone call scheduling and scripts
- Integrated voicemail drops

### Enterprise Account Penetration
The platform enabled sophisticated account-based strategies:
- Mapping entire buying committees
- Coordinating multi-threaded outreach
- Tracking engagement across stakeholders
- Triggering alerts for sales-ready accounts

### Data-Driven Optimization
Continuous improvement through AI learning:
- Real-time A/B testing of messaging
- Persona-specific content optimization
- Industry-specific value prop testing
